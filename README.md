# Hel_SFINCS

This is the model set up for my SFINCS model for Helensville, New Zealand. 
Hel_data_catalog.ipynb describes the building of the data catalog
hel_model_build.ipynb describes the building of the model itself
hel_run_postprocessing.ipynb describes the running of the SFINCS model and the postprocessing

I couldn't get the sfincs_map.nc file to upload since its more than 25 mb, which github doesn't allow in browser.
